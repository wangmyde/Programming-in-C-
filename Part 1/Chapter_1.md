## 1.1 Making a C++ program executable
To create and execute a C++ program, basically the same steps are necessary as in C:
> The program is created using an editor  
> The program is compiled  
> The linker finally creates the executable file.
## 1.2 Editor
An editor is used to create the text files that contain the C++ code. There are two different types of files:
> Source files: contain definitions of global variables and functions. Each C++ program consists of **at least one** source file.
>> The most common extensions for source files are '.cpp' and '.cc'.
> Header files: provide the information needed in various source files.
>> The most common extensions for header files are '.h', '.hpp' or nothing.
